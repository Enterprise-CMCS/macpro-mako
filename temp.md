Title: Exceptional Dental Implant Experience at Clear Choice

I recently had the pleasure of receiving a full set of dental implants from Clear Choice and I couldn't be more satisfied with the results. From the moment I walked into this wonferful clinic i was always greeted with warmth and professionalism from everyone in the staff.

The procedure is basically this:

1. Meet with the sales folks, take some xrays, pick one of the options and plan payment.
2. One long day of surgery. surgeny was amazing btw; the lights go out and you wake up with no teeth and a number of threaded screw embedded holes in your jaw. You leave with your first set of temp teeth. These will be there until your mouth heals. The pain is managed.
3. You will come in faily often to measure for fit, feel and to check healing.
4. Based on your feedback you will get another set of what your finals might will look like.

If I were to offer advice for sucess... Make sure you have a good idea of what you want the end result to look like; shape, size, and color; and make sure you talk about thos with your doc early and often.

Take notes between appointments with anything that comes up that you dont like or have questions about so you can bring them in and lak about them.

Ill say this, there are some 3rd party finacing options offerend btu ive found its best to find a way to handle finance personly through whatever makes sense. And im guessing if you are readding this you kinw that, this is not the budget option for dental implants. I, as i sure you did as well, did a lot of shopping around, taking to consults, talking to fiends, reading testimonials, and looking at picturs. ANd you should def do that. But what i found about those cut rate places is they will try and rush you through 'in a day' with a single follow up where you give you

What stood out to me most was my post op Doctor, Dr. Chi. Chi's expertise was evident, as he explained the procedure in detail, addressing all my concerns with patience and clarity, and addressed all on my concerns and questions with honesty and forthwright answers. The level of personalized care and attention I received fro him was exceptional.

The procedure itself was smooth, and the outcome exceeded my expectations. I am thrilled with the look and feel of my dental implants. It's not just about the aesthetic improvement; it's the boost in confidence and comfort that has made a significant difference in my life.

I highly recommend Clear Choice to anyone considering dental implants. Their exceptional service, combined with their commitment to patient satisfaction, makes them stand out in the field of dental care. Thank you, Clear Choice, for your outstanding service and for giving me a reason to smile with confidence again!
