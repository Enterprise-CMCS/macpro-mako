Statute: 1916, 1916A
Regulation: 42 CFR 447.52 - 447.54


INTRODUCTION
This state plan page (fillable PDF) G2c is used to indicate if the state targets cost sharing charges (deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments) to specific groups of individuals covered under the state plan, and if so, the provisions for administering targeted cost sharing. Non-targeted cost sharing imposed on categorically and medically needy individuals are covered in separate state plan pages (G2a for categorically needy and G2b for medically needy).


State plan page G2c need only be submitted when changes are being proposed to provisions contained on page G2c.


BACKGROUND
For background information related to the cost sharing state plan pages, including state plan page G2c, please see separate Implementation Guide, titled “Background - Medicaid Cost Sharing.”
 
TECHNICAL GUIDANCE


PREREQUISITES:


If the state is proposing to establish new targeted cost sharing or modify existing targeted cost sharing in the state plan, it must submit the following pages prior to or concurrently with state plan page G2c. These prerequisites do not apply to states proposing to discontinue cost sharing currently charged to targeted populations under the state plan. 


* G1 - Cost Sharing Requirements 
* G3 - Cost Sharing Limitations 


This state plan page is divided into 3 major sections:


* Option for Targeting Cost Sharing to Specific Groups of Individuals 
* Cost Sharing For Non-Preferred Drugs Charged to Otherwise Exempt Individuals 
* Cost Sharing For Non-Emergency Services Provided in the Emergency Department (ED) Charged to Otherwise Exempt Individuals 


Review Criteria


For each Yes or No question, if Yes or No is not selected by the state, this state plan page cannot be approved. 


Option for Targeting Cost Sharing to Specific Groups of Individuals
The state must first indicate Yes or No as to whether it targets cost sharing to a specific group or groups of individuals.


If a state currently charges cost sharing to other populations in addition to targeted cost sharing  and wants only to discontinue targeted cost sharing currently charged under the state plan, they should submit G2c and indicate No. If a state wants to discontinue all cost sharing currently imposed under the state plan, the state need submit only state plan page G1 and no other state plan page. 


States modifying existing cost sharing or proposing to impose cost sharing under 1916A authority (i.e. targeted cost sharing charged to specified eligibility groups with incomes greater than 100% of the FPL) must select Yes. States currently imposing or proposing to impose cost sharing under both 1916 and 1916 A authority (i.e. nominal cost sharing charged to all categorically and/or medically needy individuals and also higher than nominal cost sharing charged to specified eligibility groups with incomes greater than 100% of the FPL) must also select Yes to this question.


If No, no additional information is requested. If the state selects Yes, that is the state targets cost sharing to specific groups of individuals, additional text is displayed for the state to provide specifics regarding targeted cost sharing.


Note: States may not target cost sharing to specific groups of individuals with incomes equal to or less than 100% FPL. This state plan page is used only for targeting cost sharing to specific groups of individuals with incomes greater than 100% FPL. 


The following subsections must be completed for each targeted group:


Targeting Criteria
This section begins with, at state option, entry of a name for the population being targeted. 


A population is a group of individuals that has the exact same cost sharing provisions. If cost sharing amounts vary by eligibility group(s) and/or family income, each combination of eligibility groups and/or income ranges with different cost sharing amounts are considered as separate populations. If a state targets more than one population, the information for each population must be entered separately.  Populations/Eligibility Groups can be added by clicking on the “Add Population” button on the bottom left hand corner immediately below the section of the last population entered. To remove a population, click on the “Remove Population” button located on the bottom right corner of the section of the population to be removed.


The state must then enter the name(s) of the eligibility group(s) and income range of the targeted population. The name(s) of the eligibility group(s)s should correspond to the names of the eligibility group(s) covered under the state plan and must not include eligibility groups which are exempt from cost sharing. 


Review Criteria


The state must enter the names of the eligibility group(s) being targeted and must not include an exempt eligibility group(s) or this state plan page cannot be approved. 


Next, the state must enter the income range being targeted.


There are two fields to enter the income range, labeled “Incomes Greater than” for the lower end of the income range and “Incomes Less than or Equal to” for the upper bound of the income range. In these fields, the state enters the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) percentages or dollar amounts for household income of the targeted group. For entry of FPL levels, the state should include the percentage symbol (%) and “FPL” to the right of the number entered in the fields (e.g. 150% FPL). For dollar entries, the state should include the dollar sign ($) to the left of the number entered in the field (e.g. $700). For dollar entries, the state should enter if it is per month, quarter, year, etc. ($700/month). 


Note: When using FPL levels, “Incomes Greater than” (i.e. the lower end of the income range) should be read to mean the dollar amount represented by the FPL percentage entered plus one cent (e.g. if 100% FPL for a family of 2 equals $15,510, 100% in the “Incomes Greater than” field means $15,510.01). This same rule applies to dollar amounts entered in this field (e.g. $700 entered in the “Incomes Greater than” field should be read to mean $700.01).  The one exception to this is for states whose lowest income range starts at zero. In this case the first entry for “Incomes Greater than “should be 0 (zero) and read as zero and not as one cent. 


“Incomes Less than or Equal to” (i.e. the upper end of the income range) should be read to mean the actual dollar amount entered or the dollar amount represented by the FPL percentage. For example, if 100% FPL for a family of 2 equals $15,510, 100% FPL entered for “Incomes Less than or Equal to” means $15,510. 
If the highest income level of the target population does not have an upper bound (e.g. the income range is greater than 150% FPL or greater than $700, with no upper limit then enter “No upper limit” in the “Incomes Less than or Equal to” field.


Review Criteria


The state must enter the targeted income range or this state plan page cannot be approved. If the state uses FPL percentages for family income, the FPL entered for “Incomes Greater than” must not be less than 100% FPL and the FPL entered for “Incomes Less than or Equal to” must be greater than that entered for “Incomes Greater than” or “No upper limit” or this state plan page cannot be approved. If the state uses dollar amounts for family income, the dollar amount  entered for “Incomes Greater than” must not equal less than 100% of the FPL and the dollar amount entered for “Incomes Less than or Equal to” must be greater than that entered for “Incomes Greater than” or “No upper limit” or this state plan page cannot be approved. As the Federal Poverty Level increases each year, the state must ensure that if a dollar amount is used for the lower bound of the income range, it remains at greater than 100% of the FPL.


Next, the state must enter the specifics of the cost sharing for the eligibility group entered, including services; amounts; dollars or percentage; unit of service; and other relevant information in the cost sharing table.  
Cost Sharing Table
Each service or item for which cost sharing will be charged and its corresponding information must be entered on a separate row. Rows can be added by clicking on the + (plus) sign on the left side of a row.  To remove rows, click on the “X” key on the right side of the row. Please see section labeled “Instructions for Required Information” below.


If the cost sharing amount varies by the cost of the service or item, re-enter the service or item on a separate row for each cost sharing amount. The cost of the service or item to which the cost sharing applies should be written to the right of the name of the service or item. See example 1.


Example 1
Service or item 
	Amount
	Dollars or Percentage
	Unit
	Office Visit reimbursed at $30 or less 
	 2.00 
	$
	Per Visit
	* Office Visit reimbursed at more than $30
	 4.00 
	$
	Per Visit
	

If the state does not vary the cost sharing charge based on what the agency pays for the service, the state must include in the explanation column the average amount the agency pays for the service or item. The amount of cost sharing for individuals with income great than 100% FPL but at or below 150% of the FPL must not exceed 10% of what the agency pays for the service. The amount of cost sharing for individuals with income great than 150% of the FPL must not exceed 20% of what the agency pays for the service. See Example 2


Note: For non-preferred drugs, the cost sharing is limited to nominal amounts as defined in the regulation at 42 CRF 447.53 for individuals with income at or below 150% of the FPL, and 20% of what the agency pays for individuals with income over 150% of the FPL. For non-emergency services provide in a hospital ED, there is no limit on the cost sharing for individuals with income greater than 150% of the FPL, other than the fact that the cost sharing cannot be equal to or more than what the agency pays for the service and premiums and cost sharing for all services have a 5% of family income aggregate limit).


Example 2
Service or item 
	Amount
	Dollars or Percentage
	Unit
	Explanation
	Office Visit 
	 6.00 
	$
	Per Visit
	The average reimbursement for office visits is $65 
	* Laboratory 
	 7.00 
	$
	Per Visit
	The average reimbursement for laboratory  is $85
