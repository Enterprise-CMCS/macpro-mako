        Jekyll provides access to YAML, JSON, CSV, and TSV in the `_data` directory using `site.data`. It supports retrieving data nested in directories, files, and objects. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/
    
        Get the data from the `total` field in `_data/coverage/coverage-summary.json` and assign it to a variable called `total`.
      -->
      {% assign total = site.data.coverage.coverage-summary.total %}
      <!--
        Jekyll uses includes to create reusable snippets of html code. Data can be passed through to the snippet using parameters. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/
      
        Include the html snippet in `_includes/coverage-summary.html` with the parameters "main" as `branch` and the totals from the data as `total`.
      -->
