## Overview

The {{ site.repo.name }} project is a redesign of MACPRO Onemac. The mission to be a modern submission and review portal for select CMS data remains the same, but the architecture is different in some important ways.

## Architecture

A diagram is often the best way to communicate the architecture:

## Development Metrics (DORA)

We programmatically publish a set of Development metrics that align to the DevOps Research and Assesment (DORA) standards.  Those metrics can be viewed [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.repo.name }}/metrics/dora).

## AWS Resources

You can view and download a list of all aws resources this project uses for higher environments [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.repo.name }}/metrics/aws).
