# GitHub Actions
{: .no_toc }

Details on our workflows! 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that can be used in any GitHub repository.  It's organized at the highest level into [workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows).  Each workflow is defined in its own file located in .github/workflows/.  Each workflow file defines one or more jobs to run and when to run them.

This section will detail each of the project's workflows.  Some may require a fair amount of detail, others may be simple and obvious.  For sake of portability, each will be documented in its own file in this documentation site. 

If you see any gaps, please let us know!  GitHub Actions is really the production floor of our product, and its important to have complete documentation.
