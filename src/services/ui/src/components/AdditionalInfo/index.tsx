        Thanks, thanks a lot. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Of
        course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance theyre supposed to go to
        this, thats where they kiss for the first time. Thats Strickland. Jesus,

        Right. Yeah, well, I still dont understand what Dad was doing in the
        middle of the street. But, what are you blind McFly, its there. How else
        do you explain that wreck out there? The appropriate question is, werent
        the hell are they. Einstein has just become the worlds first time
        traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be
        exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should catch up with him and the time
        machine. Ahh.

        Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
        Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
        seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has
        gone before. Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but its
        actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the
        survival of the human species.
